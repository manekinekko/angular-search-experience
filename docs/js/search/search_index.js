are the guidelines we would like you to follow:\n\nCode of Conduct\nIssues and Bugs\nFeature Requests\nCoding Rules\nCommit Message Guidelines\nSigning the CLA\n\n Code of Conduct\nPlease read and follow our Code of Conduct.\n Found a Bug?\nIf you find a bug in the source code, you can help us by\nsubmitting an issue to our [GitHub Repository][github]. Even better, you can\nsubmit a Pull Request with a fix.\n Missing a Feature?\nYou can request a new feature by submitting an issue to our GitHub\nRepository. If you would like to implement a new feature, please submit an issue with\na proposal for your work first, to be sure that we can use it.\nPlease consider what kind of change it is:\n\nFor a Major Feature, first open an issue and outline your proposal so that it can be\ndiscussed. This will also allow us to better coordinate our efforts, prevent duplication of work,\nand help you to craft the change so that it is successfully accepted into the project.\nSmall Features can be crafted and directly submitted as a Pull Request.\n\n Commit Message Guidelines\nWe have very precise rules over how our git commit messages can be formatted. This leads to more\nreadable messages that are easy to follow when looking through the project history. But also,\nwe use the git commit messages to generate the change log.\nCommit Message Format\nEach commit message consists of a header, a body and a footer. The header has a special\nformat that includes a type, a scope and a subject:\n(): \n\n\n\nThe header is mandatory and the scope of the header is optional.\nAny line of the commit message cannot be longer 100 characters! This allows the message to be easier\nto read on GitHub as well as in various git tools.\nThe footer should contain a closing reference to an issue if any.\nSamples: (even more samples)\ndocs(changelog): update changelog to beta.5fix(release): need to depend on latest rxjs and zone.js\n\nThe version in our package.json gets copied to the one we publish, and users need the latest of these.Revert\nIf the commit reverts a previous commit, it should begin with revert:, followed by the header of the reverted commit. In the body it should say: This reverts commit ., where the hash is the SHA of the commit being reverted.\nType\nMust be one of the following:\n\nbuild: Changes that affect the build system or external dependencies (example scopes: gulp, broccoli, npm)\nci: Changes to our CI configuration files and scripts (example scopes: Travis, Circle, BrowserStack, SauceLabs)\ndocs: Documentation only changes\nfeat: A new feature\nfix: A bug fix\nperf: A code change that improves performance\nrefactor: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature\nstyle: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, missing semi-colons, etc)\ntest: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests\n\nScope\nThe scope should be the name of the npm package affected (as perceived by the person reading the changelog generated from commit messages.\nSubject\nThe subject contains a succinct description of the change:\n\nuse the imperative, present tense: \"change\" not \"changed\" nor \"changes\"\ndon't capitalize the first letter\nno dot (.) at the end\n\nBody\nJust as in the subject, use the imperative, present tense: \"change\" not \"changed\" nor \"changes\".\nThe body should include the motivation for the change and contrast this with previous behavior.\nFooter\nThe footer should contain any information about Breaking Changes and is also the place to\nreference GitHub issues that this commit Closes.\nBreaking Changes should start with the word BREAKING CHANGE: with a space or two newlines. The rest of the commit message is then used for this.\nA detailed explanation can be found in this document.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                   \n    \n         results matching \"\"\n

available at this URL: angular-search-experience.firebaseapp.com\n  \n  \n\n\nSetting up the project\nThis project was generated with Angular CLI version 6.0.0-rc.4.\nCloning the source files\nIn order to download (clone) this project on your machine, you need to have git installed. Read more on how to install Git on your system.\nOnce installed, open up a terminal shell and clone this repository using the following command:\n> git clone https://github.com/manekinekko/angular-search-experience.git\n> cd angular-search-experienceInstalling the dependencies\nYou will need yarn to install this project's dependencies. If you don't have yarn installed, here is the official documentation. Next, Using your terminal, you will need to change directory to the folder where you previously cloned this project; by default (if you copied the commad line from above) this would be angular-search-experience:\n> cd angular-search-experience\n> yarnDevelopement server: the backend\nThe backed is relying on a Serverless architecture implemented Cloud Functions for Firebase. This project comes with firebase-tools as a local dependency. Please note that this dependency is usually installed globally.\nAlso, the Firebase runtine is using an older version of Node.js: v6.11.5. We've included a .nvmrc folder under /functions. This special file is used by NVM allowing you to easily switch between diffent versions of Node.js on your machine. If you don't have NVM installed, here is the installation guide.\nUse NVM to install the required Node.js version and then use it (inside the /functions folder):\n> nvm install 6.11.5\n> nvm useNow that you are using Node.js v6.11.5, you are ready to run (ie. emulate) the search Cloud Function locally. For that, run yarn start:backend. This command will do two things:\n\nchange directory to the /functions folder (found at the root of the project). This folder contains all the backend code.\nThen it will serve the search Cloud Function locally on http://localhost:5000/angular-search-experience/us-central1/search\n\n\nImportant: Please note that the search function implements only the POST and DELETE HTTP methods, allowing you to add and delete an entity, so you will need an HTTP client, such as cURL or Postman, to be able to request the Cloud Function.\n\nDevelopment server: the front-end application\nAt the root of the project, run yarn start for a dev server. Navigate to http://localhost:4200/. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.\nBuild\nRun yarn build to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the dist/angular-search-experience/ directory. Use the yarn build:prod flag for a production build.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                   \n    \n         results matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"license.html":{"url":"license.html","title":"getting-started - license","body":"\n                   \n\nMIT License\nCopyright (c) 2018 Wassim Chegham (@manekienkko)\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\ncopies or substantial portions of the Software.\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
